# Learning Kotlin: A Structured Journey

This repository is dedicated to learning Kotlin in an easy and structured way. It documents my personal learning process, but you can also use it as a resource to learn Kotlin yourself.

I tracked my progress and organized lessons as I learned, often asking AI tools for explanations and examples on various topics. Each lesson is based on what I learned, with practical examples and clear explanations.
i never saw any tutorial for this learning , 
if u intreasted in learning kotlin, according to my pattern  u should know abit of programming then it would be much better , 
before learning , be ready with kolin ,vsc, jdk , android studio and sdk tools setuped on your pc/laptop 

**Tools Used:**
- **Version Control & Notes:** GitHub, Git, VS Code, Notion
- **AI Assistants:** ChatGPT, DeepSeek, GitHub Copilot

Feel free to follow along, use the lessons, and adapt them to your own learning pace!
